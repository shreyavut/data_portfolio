# Baltimore Reporting
I'm assisting Professor Rob Wells at the University of Maryland with spatial and demographic data analysis for reporting efforts on inequity in Baltimore. This work is not published yet, and data used in our analysis has not been included in this folder.

To see an interactive map created from my analysis for reporter use, click [here](https://profrobwells.github.io/Baltimore/rlining_and_demographics.html).

I pivoted this analysis to a Shiny app! Check out my code for that [here](https://github.com/shreyavut/baltimore-divided-app) and see the final results [here](https://cnsmaryland.shinyapps.io/baltimore-divided-app/).
