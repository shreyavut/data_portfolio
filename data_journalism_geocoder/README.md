# Reverse Geocoder
I reverse-geocoded (lat/long to census tract) the Washington Post Shootings database in order to to determine if police shootings happened disproportionately in high-poverty and majority-black neighborhoods within high-population counties.

The analysis work in clean_data_analysis.Rmd was part of a group project for a data journalism class.
