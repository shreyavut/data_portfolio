# University of Maryland COVID-19 Data Analysis
I cleaned and analyzed historical COVID-19 data from the University of Maryland on deadline for a [story](https://dbknews.com/2022/10/03/umd-more-than-1200-covid-19-cases-first-month-fall/) about the lack of COVID transparency.

Our data team at The Diamondback filed a records request for historic COVID-19 data after an initial request uncovered that UMD identified 700 COVID-19 cases during he first two weeks of school, but did not publish the data. 

The code here joins a hand-made database of UMD policy decisions regarding COVID-19 from August 2020 forward to a dataset of COVID-19 cases broken down by faculty, staff, student and reporting type from May 2020. It also pivots the data such that the role of the person reporting the case and the method by which they reported the case are in columns instead of rows for easier understanding.
