# Elections Map 
I created a map on deadline of early voting and election day polling locations ahead of early voting in Prince George's County. I converted data from .pdf to .csv format, cleaned and geocoded addresses using the Google Maps API. The map was created using the Leaflet package in R. I also produced a static version of the map for promotion on social media. 

The resulting map can be seen in [this story](https://dbknews.com/2022/10/27/early-voting-prince-georges-county/).
